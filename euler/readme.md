Project Euler Solutions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 16 18 19 20

Functions for each solution are named pn, where n is the problem number. 

⎕IO←0 is default, Functions that require ⎕IO←1 are set in the function body

Functions are niladic, except the following

pn: <arg>

p12 1

p8 requires a text file found in this directory
